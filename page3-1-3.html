			Case binding, also known as hardcover binding, is a method commonly used for creating durable and high-quality hardcover books. Here's an overview of the case binding process:</p>
		
		<p class="text"><b>Preparation of Book Block: </b> The first step in case binding is to prepare the book block, which consists of the assembled pages of the book. The pages may be printed on large sheets of paper and folded into signatures, or they may be printed individually and collated into the desired sequence. </p>
		<p class="text"><b>Sewing (Optional):  </b>In traditional case binding, the signatures of the book block may be sewn together along the spine edge using thread. Sewing provides additional strength and durability to the binding, especially for thicker books. However, in modern case binding, adhesive binding may also be used instead of sewing. </p>
		<p class="text"><b>Milling and Gluing: </b>  After sewing (if applicable), the spine edge of the book block is milled or roughened to create a rough surface. This rough surface increases the adhesion of the glue. A layer of hot melt adhesive or cold glue is then applied to the milled spine edge of the book block.</p>
		<p class="text"><b>Attachment to Case: </b> While the adhesive is still wet, the book block is attached to the hardcover case. The case consists of a rigid cover made of cardboard or paperboard, which has been wrapped in cloth, leather, or another decorative material. The book block is aligned with the spine edge of the case and pressed firmly into the adhesive. </p>
		<p class="text"><b>Casing-in: </b>  The book block and case are then placed in a casing-in press, which applies pressure to ensure a strong bond between the book block and the case. The excess material of the case is folded over the edges of the book block to create flaps, which are then glued to the inside covers of the case.</p>
		<p class="text"><b> Drying and Curing: </b>Once the adhesive has set, the case-bound book undergoes a drying and curing process to allow the adhesive to fully harden. This ensures that the book remains securely bound and the cover does not delaminate. </p>
		<p class="text"><b>Finishing Touches: </b>  After curing, the finished case-bound book may undergo additional finishing touches, such as adding endpapers, foil stamping, embossing, or other decorative elements to enhance its appearance and durability.</p>
		<p class="text">Case binding offers several advantages, including durability, professional appearance, and the ability to accommodate thicker book blocks. It is commonly used for textbooks, novels, reference books, and other publications where longevity and quality are important considerations. </p>
