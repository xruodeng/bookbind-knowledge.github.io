		<p class="text">Papyrus scrolls were an essential medium for written communication in ancient Egypt and other civilizations of the Mediterranean region. Here's an overview of papyrus scrolls:</p>
		<p class="text"><b>Material:</b> Papyrus scrolls were made from the pith of the papyrus plant, which grew abundantly along the banks of the Nile River in ancient Egypt. The pith was harvested, cut into thin strips, and then laid out in two layers, with one layer placed horizontally and the other vertically. The layers were then pounded together and dried under pressure to form a sturdy writing surface.</p>
		<p class="text"><b>Preparation:</b> Before writing, the surface of the papyrus was smoothed and polished using a hard, smooth object such as a shell or a stone. This process created a flat and even surface suitable for writing with ink.</p>
		<p class="text"><b>Writing:</b> Writing on papyrus scrolls was typically done using reed pens and ink made from carbon-based materials mixed with water and gum arabic as a binder. The text was written in columns from left to right, and the length of the scroll varied depending on the content being recorded.</p>
		<p class="text"><b>Construction:</b> Once the writing was complete, the papyrus sheet was rolled from one end to the other, creating a scroll. The ends of the scroll were often sealed with decorative caps made of wood, ivory, or metal. Sometimes, a title label known as a "titulus" was attached to the outside of the scroll to identify its contents.</p>
		<p class="text"><b>Storage and Use: </b>Papyrus scrolls were used for a wide range of purposes, including religious texts, literary works, legal documents, and administrative records. They were stored in cylindrical containers known as "scrinia" or "pyxides" to protect them from damage and deterioration. Scholars and scribes would unroll the scrolls horizontally as they read or referenced the text, gradually rolling them back up as needed.</p>
